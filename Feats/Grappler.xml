      <Text>You’ve developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling.
You gain the following benefits: 
• You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.
• You can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.</Text>
