      <Name>Tinker</Name>
      <Text>You have proficiency with artisan’s tools (tinker’s tools).
Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp).
The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it.
You can have up to three such devices active at a time.
When you create a device, choose one of the following options: 

Clockwork Toy.
This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier.
When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction.
It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.

Fire Starter.
The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire.
Using the device requires your action.

Music Box.
When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume.
The box stops playing when it reaches the song’s end or when it is closed.</Text>
